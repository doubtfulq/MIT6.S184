\section{Constructing the Training Target}
\label{sec:fokker_planck}

In the previous section, we constructed flow and diffusion models where we obtain trajectories $(X_t)_{0\leq t\leq 1}$ by simulating the ODE/SDE
\begin{align}
\label{e:sde_generative_model_restated_section_3}
 X_0\sim&\pinit,\quad \dd X_t = u_t^\theta(X_t)\dd t& \text{(Flow model)}\\
 X_0\sim&\pinit,\quad \dd X_t = u_t^\theta(X_t)\dd t + \sigma_t\dd W_t& \text{(Diffusion model)}
\end{align}
where $u_t^\theta$ is a neural network and $\sigma_t$ is a fixed diffusion coefficient. Naturally, if we just randomly initialize the parameters $\theta$ of our neural network $u_t^\theta$, simulating the ODE/SDE will just produce nonsense. As always in machine learning, we need to train the neural network. We accomplish this by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$, such as the \themebf{mean-squared error}
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \lVert u_t^\theta(x)-\underbrace{\uref_t(x)}_{\text{training target}}\rVert^2 ,
\end{align*}
where $\uref_t(x)$ is the \themebf{training target} that we would like to approximate. To derive a training algorithm, we proceed in two steps: In this chapter, our goal is to \textbf{find an equation for the training target $\uref_t$}. In the next chapter, we will describe a training algorithm that approximates the training target $\uref_t$. Naturally, like the neural network $u_t^\theta$, the training target should itself be a vector field $\uref_t:\mathbb{R}^d\times[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^d$. Further, $\uref_t$ should do what we want $u_t^\theta$ to do: convert noise into data. \textbf{Therefore, the goal of this chapter is to derive a formula for the training target $u_t^\text{ref}$ such that the corresponding ODE/SDE converts $\pinit$ into $\pdata$}. Along the way we will encounter two fundamental results from physics and stochastic calculus: the \themebf{continuity equation} and the \themebf{Fokker-Planck equation}. As before, we will first describe the key ideas for ODEs before generalizing them to SDEs.

\begin{remarkbox}
There are a number of different approaches to deriving a training target for flow and diffusion models. The approach we present here is both the most general and arguably most simple and is in line with recent state-of-the-art models. However, it might well differ from other, older presentations of diffusion models you have seen. Later, we will discuss  alternative formulations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Conditional and Marginal Probability Path}

The first step of constructing the training target $\uref_t$ is by specifying a \themebf{probability path}. Intuitively, a probability path specifies a gradual interpolation between noise $\pinit$ and data $\pdata$ (see \cref{fig:noising_image}). We explain the construction in this section. In the following, for a data point $z\in\mathbb{R}^d$, we denote with $\delta_{z}$ the \themebf{Dirac delta} ``distribution''. This is the simplest distribution that one can imagine: sampling from $\delta_{z}$ always returns $z$ (i.e. it is deterministic). A \themebf{conditional (interpolating) probability path} is a set of distribution $p_t(x|z)$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that:
\begin{align}
    % p_t(\cdot|z) \text{ distribution over }\R^d \quad (0\leq t\leq 1)\\
\label{eq:interpolating_condition_conditional_path}
    p_0(\cdot|z)=\pinit, \quad p_1(\cdot|z)=\delta_{z}\quad \text{ for all }z\in\R^d.
\end{align}
In other words, a conditional probability path gradually converts a \themeit{single} data point into the distribution $\pinit$ (see e.g. \cref{fig:noising_image}). You can think of a probability path as a trajectory in the space of distributions. Every conditional probability path $p_t(x|z)$ induces a \themebf{marginal probability path} $p_t(x)$ defined as the distribution that we obtain by first sampling a data point $z\sim \pdata$ from the data distribution and then sampling from $p_t(\cdot|z)$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:marginal_prob_path}
    z&\sim\pdata, \quad x\sim p_t(\cdot|z)\quad \Rightarrow x\sim p_t &&\blacktriangleright\,\,\text{sampling from marginal path}\\
    p_t(x) &= \int p_t(x|\dap) \pdata (z) \dd z &&\blacktriangleright\,\,\text{density of marginal path}
\end{align}
Note that we know how to sample from $p_t$ but we don't know the density values $p_t(x)$ as the integral is intractable. Check for yourself that because of the conditions on $p_t(\cdot|z)$ in \cref{eq:interpolating_condition_conditional_path}, the marginal probability path $p_t$ interpolates between $\pinit$ and $\pdata$:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:noise_interpolation}
p_0 =\pinit\quad\text{and}\quad p_1=\pdata.\quad\quad\quad\quad \blacktriangleright\,\,\text{noise-data interpolation}
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[!t]

\caption{\label{fig:cond_marginal_path_histograms}Illustration of a conditional (top) and marginal (bottom) probability path. Here, we plot a Gaussian probability path with $\alpha_t=t,\beta_t=1-t$. The conditional probability path interpolates a Gaussian $\pinit=\mathcal{N}(0,I_d)$ and $\pdata=\delta_{z}$ for single data point $z$. The marginal probability path interpolates a Gaussian and a data distribution $\pdata$ (Here, $\pdata$ is a toy distribution in dimension $d=2$ represented by a chess board pattern.)}
\end{figure}
% Note our goal in \cref{e:end_points_match} doesn't say anything about how $p_t^\theta$ should look like for intermediate time points $0<t<1$. Therefore, there is more degrees of freedom that we are allowed to choose.\footnote{It is also possible to optimize over all possible $p_t^\theta$. An example is Neural ODEs (see \cref{subsec:neural_odes}) or SchrÃ¶dinger Bridges \citep{shi2024diffusion}. However, these methods usually don't scale well to large high-dimensional data such as images, videos, or molecules.}We do so by specifying an \themebf{(interpolating) probability path} $(p_t)_{0\leq t\leq 1}$ given by:
% \begin{align}
%     p_t \text{ distribution over }\R^d \quad (0\leq t\leq 1)\\
%     \label{eq:interpolating_condition}
%     p_0=\pinit, \quad p_1=\pdata
% \end{align}
% Intuitively, an interpolating probability path starts at the distribution $\pinit$ and ends at distribution $\pdata$. With this, we can say that we want $p_t^\theta$ to match $p_t$ along the entire trajectory:
% \begin{align}
%     \label{eq:prob_path_matching}
%     \textbf{Matching probability paths: }p_t^\theta = p_t \quad \text{ for all }0\leq t \leq 1
% \end{align}
% Therefore, we guide the trajectory for all $0\leq t\leq 1$. This is a stronger but sufficient requirement for final distributions to match (see \cref{e:end_points_match}). However, it is intuitive why this might be beneficial: we give "feedback" along the whole trajectory instead of only at the end. The most important reason is however: There exists a nice mathematical equation to ensure that \cref{eq:prob_path_matching} holds, specifically the famous \emph{Fokker-Planck Equation} that we will explain in the next section. In this section, it remains to explain how one can construct interpolating probability paths.

% \paragraph{Conditional probability path.} Let us consider the most simple data distribution that one can imagine: a single data point. In other words, $\pdata=\delta_{\dap}$ where $z\in\mathbb{R}^d$ is a fixed point. The notation $\delta_{\dap}$ refers to the \themebf{Dirac delta} distribution.  Sampling from $\pdata=\delta_{\dap}$ will always return the same point $\dap$. It is therefore a rather trivial distribution. Let us try to convert $\delta_z$ into the distribution $\pinit$. We do this via \themebf{conditional (interpolating) probability path} $p_t(x|z)$ defined via
% \begin{align}
%     p_t(\cdot|z) \text{ distribution over }\R^d \quad (0\leq t\leq 1)\\
% \label{eq:interpolating_condition_conditional_path}
%     p_0(\cdot|z)=\pinit, \quad p_1(\cdot|z)=\delta_{z}\quad \text{ for all }z\in\R^d
% \end{align}
% In other words, a conditional probability path gradually converts a single data point into the distribution $p_0=\pinit$. Let's examine several examples of conditional probability paths.

\begin{examplebox}[Gaussian Conditional Probability Path]
\label{example:gaussian_path}
    One particularly popular probability path is the \themebf{Gaussian probability path}. This is the \textbf{probability path used by denoising diffusion models}. Let $\alpha_t,\beta_t$ be \themebf{noise schedulers}: two continuously differentiable, monotonic functions with $\alpha_0=\beta_1=0$ and $\alpha_1=\beta_0=1$. We then define the conditional probability path
\begin{align}
\label{eq:gaussian_conditional_probability_paths}
p_t(\cdot|\dap) &= \mathcal{N}(\alpha_t \dap,\beta_t^2 I_d)
& \blacktriangleright \,\, \text{Gaussian conditional path}
\end{align}
which, by the conditions we imposed on $\alpha_t$ and $\beta_t$, fulfills
\begin{align*}
    p_0(\cdot|\dap) &= \mathcal{N}(\alpha_0 \dap,\beta_0^2 I_d) = \mathcal{N}(0,I_d),\quad \text{and}\quad
p_1(\cdot|\dap) = \mathcal{N}(\alpha_1 \dap,\beta_1^2 I_d) = \delta_{\dap},
\end{align*}
where we have used the fact that a normal distribution with zero variance and mean $\dap$ is just $\delta_{\dap}$. Therefore, this choice of $p_t(x|\dap)$ fulfills \cref{eq:interpolating_condition_conditional_path} for $\pinit=\mathcal{N}(0,I_d)$ and is therefore a valid conditional interpolating path. The Gaussian conditional probability path has several useful properties which makes it especially amenable to our goals, and because of this we will use it as our prototypical example of a conditional probability path for the rest of the section. In \cref{fig:noising_image}, we illustrate its application to an image. We can express sampling from the marginal path $p_t$ as: 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:gaussian_prob_path_sampling}
    z\sim&\pdata,\,\epsilon\sim\pinit = \mathcal{N}(0,I_d) \,\Rightarrow\, x=\alpha_tz+\beta_t \epsilon\sim p_t \quad &\blacktriangleright \,\,\text{sampling from marginal Gaussian path}
\end{align}
Intuitively, the above procedure adds more noise for lower $t$ until time $t=0$, at which point there is only noise. In \cref{fig:cond_marginal_path_histograms}, we plot an example of such an interpolating path between Gaussian noise and a simple data distribution.
\end{examplebox}

% \paragraph{Marginal probability path.}
% Let now be $\pdata$ be arbitrary again. How can we convert $\pdata$ into $\pinit$? As we just learnt, we can do it for a fixed data point $z\in \mathbb{R}^d$ with a conditional interpolating path $p_t(\cdot|z)$. We can naturally extend this to $\pdata$ via the hierarchical sampling procedure:
% \begin{subequations}
% \label{eq:sampling_procedure_marginal_path}
% \begin{align}
%     &\text{Step 1. Draw random data point from data set: }z\sim \pdata\\
%     &\text{Step 2. Draw sample from conditional interpolating path: }x\sim p_t(\cdot|z)
% \end{align}
% \end{subequations}

% We call the distribution $p_t$ of the resulting sample $x$ the \themebf{marginal (interpolating) probability path}, i.e. $x\sim p_t$. We can express the probability density of $p_t$ via
% \begin{align}
%     \label{eq:marginal_prob_path}
%     p_t(x) = \int p_t(x|\dap) \pdata (z) \dd z
% \end{align}
% i.e. we marginalize over the data distribution. Note that because of the conditions on $p_t(\cdot|z)$ in \cref{eq:interpolating_condition_conditional_path}, the marginal probability path $p_t$ interpolates between $\pinit$ and $\pdata$:
% \begin{align*}
% p_0 = \pinit,\quad p_1=\pdata
% \end{align*}
% You can check this for yourself: If $t=0$, then $p_t(x|z)=\pinit$ regardless of $z$ (see \cref{eq:interpolating_condition_conditional_path}). Therefore, our sample $x$ will always be a sample $\pinit$ regardless of $z$. Therefore, $p_0=\pinit$. For $t=1$, we know by the definition of $\delta_{\dap}$ that $x=z\sim \pdata$. Therefore, $x\sim p_1=\pdata$.

% In other words, we found a gradual way of converting data $\pdata$ into noise $\pinit$. In \ph{INSERT FIGURE}, we plot the marginal probability path of a simple data distribution.
% How would we construct an interpolating probability path? The answer is by choosing a conditional path $p_t(x|\dap)$ and then define
% \begin{align}
%     p_t(x) = \int p_t(x|\dap) \pdata (z) \dd z
% \end{align}
% To differentiate it from $p_t(x|z)$, we call now $p_t(x)$ the \themebf{marginal (interpolating) probability path} (because you obtain it from $p_t(x|z)$ by marginalizing over the data distribution $\pdata$). The above expresses $p_t$ in the form of its probability density as an integral. It might be easier to think about how we would draw samples from the distribution $p_t$. This can be done as follows:
% \begin{align*}
%     &\text{Step 1. Draw random data point from data set: }z\sim \pdata\\
%     &\text{Step 2. Draw sample from conditional interpolating path: }x\sim p_t(\cdot|z)\\
%     \Rightarrow &\text{The resulting sample }x\text{ will have distribution }p_t
% \end{align*}
%This shows that, as desired, $p_t$ interpolates $\pinit$ and $\pdata$ (i.e. \cref{eq:interpolating_condition} is fulfilled).




% \paragraph{Summary.} Let us summarize the results of this section. In order to generate samples from $\pdata$, we choose an conditional interpolating probability path $p_t(x|\daz)$ that converts data into "noise", i.e. that fulfils
% \begin{align*}
%     \textbf{Conditional (interpolating) probability path: } p_0(\cdot|z)=\pinit, p_1(\cdot|z)=\delta_{z}
% \end{align*}
% and construct a diffusion model with neural network $u_t^\theta$
% \begin{align}
% \label{e:sde_generative_model_restated_section_3}
%  \textbf{diffusion model: }X_0\sim&\pinit,\quad \dd X_t = u_t^\theta(X_t)\dd t + \sigma_t\dd W_t
% \end{align}
% Our goal is to train $u_t^\theta$ such that it reverses this noising process, i.e. such that the distribution $p_t^\theta$ of $X_t$ matches the distribution marginalized over data points:
% \begin{align}
% \label{eq:prob_path_matching_summary}
%     \textbf{Matching marginal probability paths: }p_t^\theta = p_t =\int p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)\dd z \quad \text{ for all }0\leq t \leq 1
% \end{align}
% Step-by-step we now made the generative model problem more specific. The problem is that \cref{eq:prob_path_matching_summary} is a condition that is hard to train a machine learning for: remember, we only have access to the neural network $u_t^\theta$ explicitly but we don't really know $p_t^\theta$. Fortunately, there is a famous equation that allows us to simplify it further that we will discuss next.



\subsection{Conditional and Marginal Vector Fields}
We proceed now by constructing a training target $\uref_t$ for a flow model using the recently defined notion of a probability path $p_t$. The idea is to construct $\uref_t$ from simple components that we can derive analytically by hand.
\begin{theorem}[Marginalization trick]
\label{thm:marginalization_trick}
For every data point $z\in \mathbb{R}^d$, let $\uref_t(\cdot|z)$ denote a \themebf{conditional vector field}, defined so that the corresponding ODE yields the conditional probability path $p_t(\cdot|z)$, viz.,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:cond_ref_ode_conds}
    X_0&\sim\pinit,\quad \frac{\dd}{\dd t}X_t =\uref_t(X_t|z)\quad \Rightarrow \quad X_t\sim p_t(\cdot|z)\quad (0\leq t\leq 1).
\end{align}
Then the \themebf{marginal vector field} $\uref_t(x)$, defined by
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:marginal_vector_field}
    \uref_t(x) = \int \uref_t(x|z)\frac{p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)}{p_t(x)}\dd z,
\end{align}
follows the marginal probability path, i.e. 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:marginal_ode_follows_marginal_path}
    X_0&\sim\pinit,\quad \frac{\dd}{\dd t}X_t =\uref_t(X_t)\quad \Rightarrow \quad X_t\sim p_t\quad (0\leq t\leq 1).
\end{align}
In particular, $X_1\sim \pdata$ for this ODE, so that we might say "$\uref_t$ converts noise $\pinit$ into data $\pdata$".
\end{theorem}
See \cref{fig:cond_marginal_path_simulation} for an illustration. Before we prove the marginalization trick, let us first explain why it is useful: The marginalization trick from \cref{thm:marginalization_trick} allows us to construct the marginal vector field from a conditional vector field. This simplifies the problem of finding a formula for a training target significantly as we can often find a conditional vector field $\uref_t(\cdot|z)$ satisfying \cref{eq:cond_ref_ode_conds} analytically by hand (i.e. by just doing some algebra ourselves). Let us illustrate this by deriving a conditional vector field $u_t(x|z)$ for our running example of a Gaussian probability path.

% The marginalization trick from \cref{thm:marginalization_trick} then allows us to construct the marginal vector field from that. All that is left to do is to learn the marginal vector field, which is what flow matching does - 


% while the marginal vector field $\uref_t(\cdot)$ is generally intractable, we can often find a conditional vector field $\uref_t(\cdot|z)$ satisfying \cref{eq:cond_ref_ode_conds} analytically by hand (i.e. by just doing some algebra ourselves). The marginalization trick from \cref{thm:marginalization_trick} then allows us to relate the conditional and marginal vector fields. As it turns out, one may therefore substitute the conditional vector field $\uref_t(\cdot | z)$ in place of the marginal vector field $\uref_t(\cdot)$. We will make this intuition precise in the next section, when we discuss \themebf{flow matching}.

\end{figure}
\begin{examplebox}[Target ODE for Gaussian probability paths]
As before, let $p_t(\cdot|\dap) = \mathcal{N}(\alpha_t \dap,\beta_t^2 I_d)$ for noise schedulers $\alpha_t,\beta_t$ (see \cref{eq:gaussian_conditional_probability_paths}). Let $\dot{\alpha}_t=\partial_t\alpha_t$ and $\dot{\beta}_t=\partial_t\beta_t$ denote respective time derivatives of $\alpha_t$ and $\beta_t$. Here, we want to show that the \themebf{conditional Gaussian vector field} given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conditional_gaussian_vf}
    \uref_t(x|z) = \left(\dot{\alpha}_t-\frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t}\alpha_t\right)z+\frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t}x
\end{align}
is a valid conditional vector field model in the sense of \cref{thm:marginalization_trick}: its ODE trajectories $X_t$ satisfy $X_t\sim p_t(\cdot|z)=\mathcal{N}(\alpha_t z,\beta_t^2I_d)$ if $X_0\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_d)$. In \cref{fig:cond_marginal_path_simulation}, we confirm this visually by comparing samples from the conditional probability path (ground truth) to samples from simulated ODE trajectories of this flow. As you can see, the distribution match. We will now prove this.

\begin{proof}
Let us construct a conditional flow model $\psiref_t(x|z)$ first by defining
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cond_flow_gaussian}
    \psiref_t(x|z) = \alpha_t z + \beta_t x.
\end{align}
If $X_t$ is the ODE trajectory of $\psiref_t(\cdot|z)$ with $X_0\sim\pinit = \mathcal{N}(0,I_d)$, then by definition
\begin{align*}
    X_t = \psiref_t(X_0|z) = \alpha_t z + \beta_t X_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha_t z,\beta^2 I_d) = p_t(\cdot|z).
\end{align*}
We conclude that the trajectories are distributed like the conditional probability path (i.e, \cref{eq:cond_ref_ode_conds} is fulfilled). It remains to extract the vector field $\uref_t(x|z)$ from $\psiref_t(x|z)$. By the definition of a flow (\cref{e:flow_flow}), it holds
\begin{align*}
      \frac{\dd}{\dd t}\psiref_{t}(x|z) &= \uref_t(\psiref_t(x|z)|z)\quad \text{ for all }x,z\in\mathbb{R}^d\\
    \overset{(i)}{\Leftrightarrow} \quad \dot{\alpha}_tz+\dot{\beta}_tx &= \uref_t(\alpha_tz+\beta_t x|z)\quad \text{ for all }x,z\in\mathbb{R}^d\\
    \overset{(ii)}{\Leftrightarrow} \quad \dot{\alpha}_tz+\dot{\beta}_t\left(\frac{x-\alpha_tz}{\beta_t}\right)&= \uref_t(x|z)\quad \text{ for all }x,z\in\mathbb{R}^d\\
    \overset{(iii)}{\Leftrightarrow} \quad\left(\dot{\alpha}_t-\frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t}\alpha_t\right)z+\frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t}x &= \uref_t(x|z)\quad \text{ for all }x,z\in\mathbb{R}^d
\end{align*}
where in $(i)$ we used the definition of $\psiref_t(x|z)$ (\cref{eq:cond_flow_gaussian}), in $(ii)$ we reparameterized $x\rightarrow (x-\alpha_t z)/\beta_t$, and in $(iii)$ we just did some algebra. Note that the last equation is the conditional Gaussian vector field as we defined in \cref{eq:conditional_gaussian_vf}. This proves the statement.\footnote{One can also double check this by plugging it into the continuity equation introduced later in this section.}
\end{proof}
\end{examplebox}

The remainder of this section will now prove \cref{thm:marginalization_trick} via the \themebf{continuity equation}, a fundamental result in mathematics and physics. To explain it, we will require the use of the \themebf{divergence} operator $\divv$, which we define as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:divergence_laplacian_definition}
    \divv(v_t)(x)=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^{d}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}v_t(x)
\end{align}
\begin{theorem}[Continuity Equation]
\label{thm:continuity_equation}
Let us consider an flow model with vector field $\uref_t$ with $X_0\sim\pinit$. Then $X_t\sim p_t$ for all $0\leq t\leq 1$ if and only if
\begin{align}
\label{e:continuity_equation}
\partial_t p_t(x)=-\divv (p_t\uref_t)(x)\quad \text{ for all }x\in\R^d, 0\leq t\leq 1,
\end{align}
where $\partial_tp_t(x)= \frac{\dd}{\dd t}p_t(x)$ denotes the time-derivative of $p_t(x)$. Equation \ref{e:continuity_equation} is known as the \themebf{continuity equation}.
\end{theorem}
For the mathematically-inclined reader, we present a self-contained proof of the Continuity Equation in \cref{subsec:proof_fokker_planck}. Before we move on, let us try and understand intuitively the continuity equation. The left-hand side $\partial_tp_t(x)$ describes how much the probability $p_t(x)$ at $x$ changes over time. Intuitively, the change should correspond to the net inflow of probability mass. For a flow model, a particle $X_t$ follows along the vector field $\uref_t$. As you might recall from physics, the divergence measures a sort of net outflow from the vector field. Therefore, the negative divergence measures the net inflow. Scaling this by the total probability mass currently residing at $x$, we get that the net $-\divv (p_tu_t)$ measures the total inflow of probability mass. Since probability mass is conserved, the left-hand and right-hand side of the equation should be the same! We now proceed with a proof of the marginalization trick from \cref{thm:marginalization_trick}.
\begin{proof}
By \cref{thm:continuity_equation}, we have to show that the marginal vector field $\uref_t$, as defined as in \cref{eq:marginal_vector_field}, satisfies the continuity equation. We can do this by direct calculation:
\begin{align*}
\partial_t p_t(x) &\overset{(i)}
{=} \partial_t\int p_t(x|\dap) \pdata (z) \dd z\\
&= \int \partial_t p_t(x|\dap) \pdata (z) \dd z\\
&\overset{(ii)}{=} \int -\divv (p_t(\cdot|z)\uref_t(\cdot|z))(x) \pdata (z) \dd z\\
&\overset{(iii)}{=} -\divv \left(\int p_t(x|z) \uref_t(x|z)\pdata(z) \dd z\right)\\
&\overset{(iv)}{=} -\divv \left(p_t(x)\int \uref_t(x|z) \frac{p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)}{p_t(x)}\dd z\right)(x)\\
&\overset{(v)}{=} -\divv \left(p_t\uref_t\right)(x),
\end{align*}
where in $(i)$ we used the definition of $p_t(x)$ in \cref{eq:marginal_prob_path}, in $(ii)$ we used the continuity equation for the conditional probability path $p_t(\cdot|z)$, in $(iii)$ we swapped the integral and divergence operator using \cref{eq:divergence_laplacian_definition}, in $(iv)$ we multiplied and divided by $p_t(x)$, and in $(v)$ we used \cref{eq:marginal_vector_field}. The beginning and end of the above chain of equations show that the continuity equation is fulfilled for $\uref_t$. By \cref{thm:continuity_equation}, this is enough to imply \cref{eq:marginal_ode_follows_marginal_path}, and we are done.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Conditional and Marginal Score Functions}
We just successfully constructed a training target for a flow model. We now extend this reasoning to SDEs. To do so, let us define the \themebf{marginal score function} of $p_t$ as $\nabla\log p_t(x)$. We can use this to extend the ODE from the previous section to an SDE, as the following result demonstrates.
\begin{theorem}[SDE extension trick]
\label{thm:langevin_trick}
Define the conditional and marginal vector fields $\uref_t(x|z)$ and $\uref_t(x)$ as before. Then, for diffusion coefficient $\sigma_t\geq 0$, we may construct an SDE which follows the same probability path:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:sde_extension}
    X_0\sim&\pinit,\quad \dd X_t =\left[\uref_t(X_t)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\nabla\log p_t(X_t)\right]\dd t +\sigma_t\dd W_t\\
    \label{eq:marginal_ode_follows_marginal_path_sde}
    \Rightarrow X_t\sim& p_t\quad (0\leq t\leq 1)
\end{align}
In particular, $X_1\sim \pdata$ for this SDE. The same identity holds if we replace the marginal probability $p_t(x)$ and vector field $\uref_t(x)$ with the conditional probability path $p_t(x|z)$ and vector field $\uref_t(x|z)$.
\end{theorem}
We illustrate the theorem in \cref{fig:thm_sde_extension}. The formula in \cref{thm:langevin_trick} is useful because, similar to before, we can express the marginal score function via the \themebf{conditional score function} $\nabla\log p_t(x|z)$
\begin{align}
\label{e:marginal_score}
\nabla\log p_t(x) = \frac{\nabla p_t(x)}{p_t(x)}
=\frac{\nabla \int p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)\dd z}{p_t(x)}
=\frac{\int \nabla p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)\dd z}{p_t(x)}
=\int \nabla \log p_t(x|z)\frac{ p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)}{p_t(x)}\dd z
\end{align}
and the conditional score function $\nabla \log p_t(x|z)$ is something we usually know analytically, as illustrated by the following example.
\begin{examplebox}[Score Function for Gaussian Probability Paths.] 
For the Gaussian path $p_t(x|z)=\mathcal{N}(x;\alpha_t z,\beta_t^2 I_d)$, we can use the form of the Gaussian probability density (see \cref{e:gaussian}) to get
\begin{align}
\label{eq:cond_score_gaussian}
    \nabla \log p_t(x|z) = \nabla\log \mathcal{N}(x;\alpha_t z,\beta_t^2 I_d) = -\frac{x-\alpha_t z}{\beta_t^2}.
\end{align}
Note that the score is a linear function of $x$. This is a unique feature of Gaussian distributions.
\end{examplebox}
In the remainder of this section, we will prove  \cref{thm:langevin_trick} via the \themebf{Fokker-Planck equation}, which extends the continuity equation from ODEs to SDEs. To do so, let us first define the \themebf{Laplacian} operator $\Delta$ via
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:laplacian_definition}
    \Delta w_t(x)=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^{d}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 x_i}w_t(x)=\divv(\nabla w_t)(x).
\end{align}
\begin{theorem}[Fokker-Planck Equation]
\label{thm:fokker_planck}
Let $p_t$ be a probability path and let us consider the SDE
\begin{align*}
    X_0\sim \pinit, \quad \dd X_t = u_t(X_t)\dd t + \sigma_t\dd W_t.
\end{align*}
Then $X_t$ has distribution $p_t$ for all $0\leq t\leq 1$ if and only if the \themebf{Fokker-Planck equation} holds:
    \begin{align}
    \label{e:fokker_planck}
    \partial_t p_t(x) = -\divv (p_t u_t)(x)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta p_t (x)\quad \text{ for all }x\in\R^d, 0\leq t\leq 1.
    \end{align}     
\end{theorem}
A self-contained proof of the Fokker-Planck equation can be found in \cref{subsec:proof_fokker_planck}. Note that the continuity equation is recovered from the Fokker-Planck equation when $\sigma_t=0$. The additional Laplacian term $\Delta p_t$ might be hard to rationalize at first. Those familiar with physics will note that the same term also appears in the heat equation (which is in fact a special case of the Fokker-Planck equation). Heat diffuses through a medium. We also add a diffusion process (not a physical but a mathematical one) and hence we add this additional Laplacian term. 
Let us now use the Fokker-Planck equation to help us prove \cref{thm:langevin_trick}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{thm:langevin_trick}]
 By \cref{thm:fokker_planck}, we need to show that that the SDE defined in \cref{eq:sde_extension} satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation for $p_t$. We can do this by direction calculation:
\begin{align*}
    \partial_t p_t(x) \overset{(i)}{=}& - \divv(p_t\uref_t)(x)\\
    \overset{(ii)}{=}& - \divv(p_t\uref_t)(x) -\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta p_t(x)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta p_t(x)\\
    \overset{(iii)}{=}& - \divv(p_t\uref_t)(x) -\divv(\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\nabla p_t)(x)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta p_t(x)\\
    \overset{(iv)}{=}& - \divv(p_t\uref_t)(x) -\divv(p_t\left[\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\nabla \log p_t\right])(x)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta p_t(x)\\
    \overset{(v)}{=}&- \divv\left(p_t\left[\uref_t+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\nabla \log p_t\right]\right)(x)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\Delta p_t(x),
\end{align*}
where in $(i)$ we used the Contuity Equation, in $(ii)$ we added and subtracted the same term, in $(iii)$ we used the definition of the Laplacian (\cref{eq:laplacian_definition}), in $(iv)$ we used that $\nabla\log p_t=\frac{\nabla p_t}{p_t}$, and in $(v)$ we used the linearity of the divergence operator. The above derivation shows that the SDE defined in \cref{eq:sde_extension} satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation for $p_t$. By \cref{thm:fokker_planck}, this implies $X_t\sim p_t$ for $0\leq t\leq 1$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\end{figure}
\begin{remarkbox}[Langevin dynamics.]
The above construction has a famous special case when the probability path is static, i.e. $p_t=p$ for a fixed distribution $p$. In this case, we set $\uref_t=0$ and obtain the SDE
\begin{equation}
    \dd X_t = \frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\nabla\log p(X_t)\dd t + \sigma_t dW_t \label{eq:langevin_dynamics},
\end{equation}
which is commonly known as \themebf{Langevin dynamics}. The fact that $p_t$ is static implies that $\partial_tp_t(x)=0$. It follows immediately from \cref{thm:langevin_trick} that these dynamics satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation for the static path $p_t=p$ in \cref{thm:langevin_trick}. Therefore, we may conclude that $p$ is a stationary distribution of Langevin dynamics, so that
\begin{align*}
    X_0 \sim p\quad \Rightarrow \quad X_t \sim p\quad (t\geq 0)
\end{align*}
As with many Markov chains, these dynamics converge to the stationary distribution $p$ under rather general conditions (see \cref{fig:langevin}). That is, if we instead we take $X_0 \sim p' \neq p$, so that $X_t \sim p_t'$, then under mild conditions $p_t \to p$. This fact makes Langevin dynamics extremely useful, and it accordingly serves as the basis for e.g., \textbf{molecular dynamics} simulations, and many other Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods across Bayesian statistics and the natural sciences.
\end{remarkbox}

Let us summarize the results of this section.
\begin{summarybox}[Derivation of the Training Target]
\textbf{The flow training target is the marginal vector field $\uref_t$.} To construct it, we choose a \themebf{conditional probability path} $p_t(x|\dap)$ that fulfils $p_0(\cdot|z)=\pinit$, $p_1(\cdot|z)=\delta_{z}$. Next, we find a \themebf{conditional vector field} $\uflow_t(x|z)$ such that its corresponding flow $\psiref_t(x|z)$ fulfills
\begin{align*}
    X_0\sim \pinit \quad \Rightarrow \quad X_t = \psiref_t(X_0|z) \sim p_t(\cdot|z),
\end{align*}
or, equivalently, that $\uref_t$ satisfies the continuity equation.  Then the \themebf{marginal vector field} defined by
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:marginal_vector_field_restated}
    \uref_t(x) = \int \uref_t(x|z)\frac{p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)}{p_t(x)}\dd z,
\end{align}
follows the marginal probability path, i.e.,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:marginal_ode_follows_marginal_path_restated}
    X_0&\sim\pinit,\quad \dd X_t =\uref_t(X_t)\dd t\Rightarrow X_t\sim p_t\quad (0\leq t\leq 1).
\end{align}
In particular, $X_1\sim \pdata$ for this ODE, so that $\uref_t$ "converts noise into data", as desired.


\textbf{Extending to SDEs.} For a time-dependent diffusion coefficient $\sigma_t\geq 0$, we can extend the above ODE to an SDE with the same marginal probability path:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:sde_extension_restated}
    X_0\sim&\pinit,\quad \dd X_t =\left[\uref_t(X_t)+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\nabla\log p_t(X_t)\right]\dd t +\sigma_t\dd W_t\\
    \label{eq:marginal_ode_follows_marginal_path_restated}
    \Rightarrow X_t\sim& p_t\quad (0\leq t\leq 1),
\end{align}
where $\nabla\log p_t(x)$ is the \themebf{marginal score function}
\begin{align}
\nabla\log p_t(x) =&\int \nabla \log p_t(x|z)\frac{ p_t(x|z)\pdata(z)}{p_t(x)}\dd z.
\end{align}
In particular, for the trajectories $X_t$ of the above SDE, it holds that $X_1\sim \pdata$, so that the SDE "converts noise into data", as desired. An important example is the \themebf{Gaussian probability path}, yielding the formulae:
\begin{align}
p_t(x|z) =& \mathcal{N}(x;\alpha_t z,\beta_t^2 I_d)\\
\uflow_t(x|z)=&\left(\dot{\alpha}_t-\frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t}\alpha_t\right)z+\frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t}x\\
\nabla \log p_t(x|z) =& -\frac{x-\alpha_t z}{\beta_t^2},
\end{align}
for \themebf{noise schedulers} $\alpha_t,\beta_t\in\mathbb{R}$: continuously differentiable, monotonic functions such that $\alpha_0=\beta_1=0$ $\alpha_1=\beta_0=1$.
\end{summarybox}
